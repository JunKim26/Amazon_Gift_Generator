# Amazon Item Generator

  In this program, tkinter will be used to prompt a user to choose a category from a sample database from Amazon. Then, the user will be prompted to choose the number of outputs desired. An output file will be created with the highest rated items in the same directory as the script. A preview of the result will pop up and display a table.

Instructions: Unzip the csv file titled "amazon_co-ecommerce_sample.csv.zip" put the life-generator.py file and the csv file into the same folder and run the life-generator.py file. The output file will be saved to the same directory as the script file.
